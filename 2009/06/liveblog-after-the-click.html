Jonathan Heiliger, VP Tech Ops FB


	FB Mission: give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.


	2004: launch in MZ&#8217;s dorm room
2004-5: new apps launched (events, photos, mobile)
2006: news feed and open reg
2007: platform launch
2008: crowdsourced translations; reached 30 langs quickly (spanish 2 wks, french ~24 hrs)


	[nice map viz for growth: colorize market penetration]


	Radio took ~150 yrs (?) to reach 150M
TV: 13 yrs
Computers 4 years
FB: 3 yrs


	How FB deals


Classic battle of Ops v. Eng
	
	Ops wants no change&#8212;stability
		Eng wants lots of change&#8212;driven by users and site
		Do you really want to fight it out? Teamwork is required
		Enable individuals to reach goals, chase team success
		Make it transparent to users and safe for employees to fail
		Make it a point of pride: you don&#8217;t want to be the one who took down the site (but there&#8217;s some cache in that war story)
	


It&#8217;s the people
	
	Everyone hires the smartest people
		It&#8217;s about organizing and leading
	


	Tuning the Operating Pipeline (Eng -&gt; QA -&gt; Ops aka Dev -&gt; Test -&gt; Deploy)
(this isn&#8217;t how they did it)


	Engineering is responsible for the efficacy and reliability of their code, writing their own tests, and full lifecycle of code including pushing it live.


	Ops provides guard rails to keep eng safe from itself, prevent site downtime. Feature can go down, but rest of site is safe.


	Complaints back in the day:
Ops: Eng is way too unstructured, lobbing crap over the wall.
Eng: Ops is not nimble


	Make the problem joint; Eng owns the problem


	Continuous build, code review, peer review, perf testing has kept things moving fast while moving to 200+ eng org.


Put engineers in operations
	
	Site reliability team: stewards of the site
		Operations engineering: tooling and glue apps (workflow/pipeline)
	


Put ops in engineering (consulting engineers)
	
	Partners with backend service groups to think about architecture, scaling, reliability
		Helps mentor into full SDLC responsibility&#8212;really understand complete DEV to PROD function of code
	


	Software launch has warroom with PM, Eng, NetEng, SRE, Perf Eng, Site Integrity staff around. Always the right person on hand, physically present.


Getting it done
	
	If you can&#8217;t work as a team, you&#8217;re done
		Design is awesome, but it needs execution to succeed
	


Three things they did live expecting to break the site
	
	See how the team worked, who would step up, etc.
	


CNN livefeed
	
	Group of 20 some folks came together, marketing, eng, product, ops, etc.
		Added much capacity, made warroom
		Written from scratch in ~3 weeks
		Replicated (and improved) for Oscars, etc.
		Knew there would be point load much like DoS attack
		Added throttles to direct features, as well as throttling things like chat, number of thumbnails shown on site, etc.
		Friends had to be shown on the fly
		Common content was cached in CDN; didn&#8217;t anticipate delay/latency from CDN
		Didn&#8217;t expec users to maddly twiddle &#8220;Everyone&#8221; and &#8220;Friends&#8221; tabs (they did) &#8211; learned &#8220;cache everything&#8221; 
		During inauguraton 2M status updates, 8.5K spike at start
		Dark launched everything with users exercising the stack without any visible UI to users
		Also built perf framework to see what real user experience would be like
		Used data from both to appropriately size
	


Like
	
	Simple &#8220;I like this&#8221; on wall/status
		Didn&#8217;t expect it to get a lot of traffic at first; totally wrong
	
	4.1m users liked 7.1 M times first day
		16.3/46.2 1st week
		39.6/226.8 1st month
	
	


Username allocations
	
	Was initially to be auction (codename: hammer)
		Decided to go first come first served, kept codename&#8212;it was going to hammer the site
		Had to have blocked list of trademarks; didn&#8217;t block &#8220;asp.net&#8221; 
		Dark launch, found issues, delayed initial launch
		Launched at 9p; huge cache hit within moments, no increase in idle latency (means they got it right, maybe a little overprovisioned)
		Made pages as light as possible
		Tiny blip in overall load
	


Datacenter infra/organization is hugely important
	
	Untidiness reflects bad organization
		DC/infra is 2nd biggest exp after people
		Invest where appropriate
	


	Distribute accountability
Test with users
&#8220;The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary&#8221; &#8211; Vince lombardi


	Expects org to look different in a year&#8212;evolution is the key.

		<li>Helps mentor into full <span class="caps">SDLC</span> responsibility&#8212;really understand complete <span class="caps">DEV</span> to <span class="caps">PROD</span> function of code</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Software launch has warroom with PM, Eng, NetEng, <span class="caps">SRE</span>, Perf Eng, Site Integrity staff around. Always the right person on hand, physically present.</p>


Getting it done
	<ul>
	<li>If you can&#8217;t work as a team, you&#8217;re done</li>
		<li>Design is awesome, but it needs execution to succeed</li>
	</ul>


Three things they did live expecting to break the site
	<ul>
	<li>See how the team worked, who would step up, etc.</li>
	</ul>


<span class="caps">CNN</span> livefeed
	<ul>
	<li>Group of 20 some folks came together, marketing, eng, product, ops, etc.</li>
		<li>Added much capacity, made warroom</li>
		<li>Written from scratch in ~3 weeks</li>
		<li>Replicated (and improved) for Oscars, etc.</li>
		<li>Knew there would be point load much like DoS attack</li>
		<li>Added throttles to direct features, as well as throttling things like chat, number of thumbnails shown on site, etc.</li>
		<li>Friends had to be shown on the fly</li>
		<li>Common content was cached in <span class="caps">CDN</span>; didn&#8217;t anticipate delay/latency from <span class="caps">CDN</span></li>
		<li>Didn&#8217;t expec users to maddly twiddle &#8220;Everyone&#8221; and &#8220;Friends&#8221; tabs (they did) &#8211; learned &#8220;cache everything&#8221; </li>
		<li>During inauguraton 2M status updates, 8.5K spike at start</li>
		<li>Dark launched everything with users exercising the stack without any visible UI to users</li>
		<li>Also built perf framework to see what real user experience would be like</li>
		<li>Used data from both to appropriately size</li>
	</ul>


Like
	<ul>
	<li>Simple &#8220;I like this&#8221; on wall/status</li>
		<li>Didn&#8217;t expect it to get a lot of traffic at first; totally wrong
	<ul>
	<li>4.1m users liked 7.1 M times first day</li>
		<li>16.3/46.2 1st week</li>
		<li>39.6/226.8 1st month</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ul>


Username allocations
	<ul>
	<li>Was initially to be auction (codename: hammer)</li>
		<li>Decided to go first come first served, kept codename&#8212;it was going to hammer the site</li>
		<li>Had to have blocked list of trademarks; didn&#8217;t block &#8220;asp.net&#8221; </li>
		<li>Dark launch, found issues, delayed initial launch</li>
		<li>Launched at 9p; huge cache hit within moments, no increase in idle latency (means they got it right, maybe a little overprovisioned)</li>
		<li>Made pages as light as possible</li>
		<li>Tiny blip in overall load</li>
	</ul>


Datacenter infra/organization is hugely important
	<ul>
	<li>Untidiness reflects bad organization</li>
		<li>DC/infra is 2nd biggest exp after people</li>
		<li>Invest where appropriate</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Distribute accountability
Test with users
&#8220;The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary&#8221; &#8211; Vince lombardi</p>


	<p>Expects org to look different in a year&#8212;evolution is the key.</p>
