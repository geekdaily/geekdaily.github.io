    <p><em>[note: I originally scribbled this on paper thinking I could hand it off immediately, preventing the obligation of typing, posting, etc. Turns out I don’t get off that lightly, so here’s the spew in electrons.]</em></p>

<p>Scraping isn’t a scalable model.</p>

<p>There are biz issues around aggregating data: many businesses don’t want you to get their data, though many are becoming more open.</p>

<p>Doing aggregation right:<br />
* minimize latency<br />
* maximize engagement</p>

<p>When latency is high, it causes confusion and takes you out of real-time</p>

<p>Doing conditional gets can be somewhat useful.</p>

<p>Plaxo had to shard their crawlers, which lands you in the shared state/sync problem of any stateful system you want to scale horizontally.</p>

<p>Gnip integration has been good:<br />
* Offload the long-running processes<br />
* Gnip offers alerting or “fat ping” (ping includes update data)</p>

<p>Plaxo likes using the alert to escalate the priority of the crawler which fetches the rich data related to the update. This approach allows you to use a consistent model for content ingestion vs. get info from fat ping, then augment later.</p>

<p>Smarr: “Brad Fitzpatrick said, ‘Make polling a special case of push.’” He attributed this to someone but I missed the attribution.</p>

<p>(Don’t try to keep up with Joseph Smarr on paper. He’s thinks too many cogent thoughts too quickly to preserve legibility)</p>

<p>Plaxo uses TripIt’s RSS feed as alerting, grabs item ID, then uses their APIs to fetch rich data.</p>

<p>There’s a move to homogenize the info from sites, which may not be a good idea. It suppresses the distinctive look and feel/experience of the publishing site. Allowing for these differences means more labor spent on making one-off shims, which increases maintenance. Still, right choice in order to provide value to the user.</p>

<p>Activity streams seek to provide more rich data in a somewhat normalized, extensible format.</p>

<p>Many/most sites aren’t yet perfectly architected for real-time’s push, ping, etc.</p>

<p>PubSubHubBub and Activity Streams are externally represented data shards</p>

<p>Plaxo’s Pulse started with known architecture issues (in order to ship) and hit the wall sooner than expected. Threw hardware/software optimizations at the problem to move the wall far enough to give time for rearchitecture, sharding, and working out how to propagate changes throughout the system properly.</p>

<p>None of the NoSQL alternatives are quite ready for prime-time. Smarr: “It should be something that’s just a primitive.”</p>

<p>Conversation platforms are slightly different sorts of aggregation platforms. There are UI diffs (e.g. pause the stream when indicating interest). Handling the transition from slightly-latent/passive real-time to synchronous real-time/active not yet well-developed (think: when a comment inspires a conversation)</p>

<p>90-99% of the value of the real-time web is realized in not-real-time [unreal-time? ;] This is a big deal for discovery. Twitter and FB make this harder by obscuring history.</p>

<p>Ideal scalability/performance would be an index per user. This would be grossly inefficient due to the number of duplicate entries.</p>

<p>No one has nailed reader-controlled aggregation (Show me Joe’s tweets and blogs but not his photos) quite yet.</p>

<p>Smarr: “If we’re all kinda [sharing], we’re all making each other smarter”</p>

<p>The firehose of info is a hard model to scale to. Ben Metcalfe proposes the garden hose – a firehose filtered at the source according to your interests, which helps aggregators by allowing them to request the superset of all filters from a given publisher.</p>

<p>We really want to push contexts to the publishers and let them determine which content fits that context. Context shifts over time: Joe doesn’t normally read my tweets (and why would he?) but when we’re at a conference together, he’s much more interested (thus the popularity of hashtags). This is a geographic and purpose-driven context (the conference) as well as Joe’s context on me (Jim knows where the good bars are).</p>

<p>Folks like Twitter are so overloaded with info that they might not recognize non-immediate contexts that are interesting to me.</p>

<p>There’s also the risk of exposing users to the amount of correlatable public data they have. Many don’t want you to apply a transitive closure to identify them in all spaces even though doing so allows you to present a much more convenient UX around what they want you to aggregate.</p>

<p>Someone likened the real-time aggregation problem to a bar conversation: you get snippets here and there and follow your own thread of interestingness.</p>

<p>Three fundamental themes:<br />
* How to specify contexts to data provider/publisher<br />
* How to control access to private data (and carry ACLs with that data)<br />
* How to do all this efficiently</p>

<p>Plaxo implemented polling-back-off (poll infrequently updated sources less frequently). Turns out this is a bad idea, as it introduces latency which makes it feel broken.</p>

<p>There’s also the issue of aggregating conversation about web objecs (like blog posts) and how not to divert the conversation from the publisher’s site. However, sometimes you want a private discussion of a public object (cf. LinkedIn company groups discussing an article)</p>

<p>Q: What’s the state of open standards around this?<br />
A: PubSubHubBub and Activity Streams are very exciting. OAuth as access delegation. There’s still a lot of ground to cover.</p>
